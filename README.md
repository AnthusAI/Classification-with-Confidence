# Classification with Confidence: Using LLMs as Reliable Classifiers

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as powerful classifiers, but their black-box nature makes it difficult to assess prediction certainty. This project demonstrates how to extract confidence scores from LLM responses, enabling more reliable classification systems that can identify when they're uncertain.

## The Challenge

Traditional machine learning classifiers provide confidence scores through probability distributions. LLMs, however, typically return only text responses, making it challenging to assess prediction reliability. This is particularly problematic when dealing with:

- Domain-specific terminology the model hasn't seen
- Ambiguous or context-dependent language
- Novel slang or cultural references

## Our Approach

We demonstrate confidence estimation through **response consistency analysis** - asking the model multiple times and measuring agreement. Models show higher consistency on familiar concepts and lower consistency on unfamiliar ones.

### Key Concepts

1. **Confidence through Consistency**: Multiple model queries reveal uncertainty
2. **Domain Gap Detection**: Low confidence indicates unfamiliar terminology
3. **Targeted Improvement**: Few-shot learning can improve confidence on specific domains

## Example Use Case: Sentiment Analysis with Gen Z Slang

Our implementation focuses on sentiment classification, comparing:

**High Confidence Examples** (familiar language):
- "This is absolutely amazing!" → Positive (high confidence)
- "I hate this so much" → Negative (high confidence)

**Low Confidence Examples** (Gen Z/Alpha slang):
- "That's so skibidi" → ??? (low confidence)
- "You're literally sigma" → ??? (low confidence)
- "This is bussin fr" → ??? (low confidence)

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Base Classification
Uses Ollama with local models (e.g., Llama 3.2) for:
- Privacy-preserving inference
- Consistent, reproducible results
- Easy experimentation

### 2. Confidence Scoring
Measures prediction confidence through:
- Multiple independent queries (e.g., 5-10 runs)
- Response consistency analysis
- Agreement percentage as confidence score

### 3. Improvement Strategy
Enhances confidence through:
- Few-shot learning with slang examples
- Context-aware prompting
- Iterative refinement

## Quick Start

1. **Install Ollama**: Follow instructions at [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull a model**: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Run examples**: `python main.py`

## Expected Results

The demonstration should show:

1. **High confidence** (>80%) on standard English sentiment
2. **Low confidence** (<50%) on unfamiliar Gen Z slang
3. **Improved confidence** after few-shot learning with slang examples

## Educational Value

This project illustrates:

- How to extract confidence from non-probabilistic models
- The importance of uncertainty quantification in AI systems
- Practical approaches to handling domain-specific language
- The value of local LLMs for experimentation

## Future Directions

- **Calibration**: Converting raw consistency scores to calibrated probabilities
- **Multi-domain**: Extending beyond sentiment to other classification tasks
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing inference for real-time applications
- **Evaluation**: Systematic comparison with traditional ML approaches

## Why This Matters

Reliable AI systems need to know when they don't know. By adding confidence estimation to LLM classifiers, we can:

- Filter unreliable predictions
- Identify areas needing additional training data
- Build more trustworthy AI applications
- Enable human-AI collaboration where uncertainty matters
